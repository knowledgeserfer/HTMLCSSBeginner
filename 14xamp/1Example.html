			1. words: white, black, orange, yellow, purple, green, blue
			2.Hexadecimal value: #000000 #fffff
			#rrggbb
			Where rr (red), gg (green) and bb (blue) are hexadecimal values between 00 and ff (same as decimal 0-255).
			For example, #ff0000 is displayed as red, because red is set to its highest value (ff) and the others are set to the lowest value (00).
			3.rgb: rgb(0, 0, 0) rgb(255, 255, 255)
			Each parameter (red, green, and blue) defines the intensity of the color between 0 and 255.
			For example, rgb(255, 0, 0) is displayed as red, because red is set to its highest value (255) and the others are set to 0.
			To display black, set all color parameters to 0, like this: rgb(0, 0, 0).
			To display white, set all color parameters to 255, like this: rgb(255, 255, 255).
			4.RGBA value: rgb(0, 0, 0, 0.6)
			The alpha parameter is a number between 0.0 (fully transparent) and 1.0 (not transparent at all)
			5.HSL value: Hue - Hue, Saturation - Saturation, and Lightness - Lightness
			Hue is a degree on the color wheel from 0 to 360. 0 is red, 120 is green, and 240 is blue.
			Saturation is a percentage value, 0% means a shade of gray, and 100% is the full color.
			Lightness is also a percentage, 0% is black, 50% is neither light or dark, 100% is white
			hsl(0, 100%, 0%) hsl(0, 100%, 100%)
				
			6.HSLA value
				hsla(120,100%,50%,0.3)
			The alpha parameter is a number between 0.0 (fully transparent) and 1.0 (not transparent at all)
