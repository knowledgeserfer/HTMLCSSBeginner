			Let the element be located in some outer container. It can be a body element, a div, and so on. It is separated from other elements by some distance - an outer margin , which is described by the CSS margin property . That is, the margin property determines the distance from the border of the current element to other siblings or to the borders of an outer container.

			Then the element itself begins. And at the beginning comes its border, which in CSS is described by the border property .

			The border is followed by padding, which is described in CSS by the padding property . Padding determines the distance from the border of the element to the inner content.
