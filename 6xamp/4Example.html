			have extensive configuration options. So, depending on the value of the attribute, type we can create various types of buttons:
			submit: button used to submit the form
			reset: form reset button
			button: button without any special purpose
			If the button is used to submit the form, that is, it has an attribute set type="submit", then we can set a number of additional attributes for it:
			form: defines the form for which the submit button is assigned
			formaction: sets the address to which the form is sent. If the form element is set to an attribute action, then it is overridden
			formenctype: sets the format for sending data. If the form element has an attribute set enctype, then it is overridden
			formmethod: sets the form submission method (post or get). If the form element has an attribute set method, then it is overridden
