			display property can take the following values:
			inline: element becomes line, like words in a line of text
			block: the element becomes block like a paragraph
			inline-block: the element is positioned as a line of text
			list-item: the item is positioned as a list item, usually with the addition of a bullet in the form of a period or ordinal
			run-in: the block type of the element depends on the surrounding elements
			flex: allows flexible positioning of elements
			table, inline-table: allows you to arrange items in a table
			none: element not visible and removed from html markup

			So the block value allows you to define a block element. Such an element is visually separated from adjacent elements by a line break, such as the p paragraph element or the div element, which are block by default and are visually wrapped on a new line when rendering a web page.
