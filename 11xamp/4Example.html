			List of available pseudo-classes:

			: root : allows you to select the root element of the web page, probably the least useful selector, since on the correct web page, the root element is almost always the element<html>

			: link : applies to links and represents the link in its normal state, which has not yet been navigated to

			: visited : applies to links and represents the link that the user has already clicked on

			: active : applies to links and represents the link the moment the user clicks on it

			: hover : represents the element that the user hovers over. Applies primarily to links, but can also apply to other elements, such as paragraphs.

			: focus : represents an element that receives focus, that is, when the user presses the tab key or clicks on the input field (for example, a text field)

			: not : allows you to exclude elements from the list of elements to which the style is applied

			: lang : style elements based on attribute value lang

			: empty : selects elements that do not have nested elements, i.e. are empty
