			As mentioned above, animation, in addition to two standard keyframes, allows you to use many intermediate ones.
			
			animation-nameAnimations are listed as the property value , separated by commas, and the animation-durationtime of these animations is also specified for the property, separated by commas . The name of the animation and its time are matched by position, that is, the opacityAnimation will last 3 seconds.
			
			animation-iteration-count property determines how many times the animation will repeat. For example, 3 animation repeats in a row:

			animation-iteration-count: 3;
			If it is necessary for the animation to run an infinite number of times, then this property is assigned the value infinite :

			animation-iteration-count: infinite;
			When you repeat, the animation will start over from the start keyframe. But with the property the animation-direction: alternate; opposite direction of the animation when repeated. That is, it will start at the end keyframe, and then it will transition to the start frame:

			animation-name: backgroundColorAnimation, opacityAnimation;
			animation-duration: 2s, 2s;
			animation-iteration-count: 3;
			animation-direction: alternate;
			When the animation ends, the browser sets the animated element to the style it would have before applying the animation. But the property animation-fill-mode: forwardsallows you to set exactly the one that was in the last frame as the final value of the animated property:

			animation-name: backgroundColorAnimation;
			animation-duration: 2s;
			animation-iteration-count: 3;
			animation-direction: alternate;
			animation-fill-mode: forwards;
			Delay animation
			Using the animation-delay property, you can define the animation delay time:

			animation-name: backgroundColorAnimation;
			animation-duration: 5s;
			animation-delay: 1s; / * 1 second delay * /
			Animation smoothness function
			As with transitions, you can apply all the same easing functions to animations:
			animation-timing-function

			linear : linear easing function, property changes evenly over time

			ease : a ease function that accelerates the animation towards the middle and slows down towards the end, providing a more natural change

			ease-in : ease function that only accelerates at the start

			ease-out : ease function that only accelerates at the start

			ease-in-out : an ease function that accelerates the animation towards the middle and decelerates towards the end, providing a more natural change

			cubic-bezier - Cubic bezier is used for animation

			The animation-timing-function property is used to set the smoothness function :

			@keyframes backgroundColorAnimation {
				from {
					background-color: tomato;
				}
				to {
					background-color: yellow;
				}
			}
			div {
				width: 150px;
				height: 150px;
				margin: 50px 30px;
				border: 1px solid gray;
							
				animation-name: backgroundColorAnimation;
				animation-duration: 3s;
				animation-timing-function: ease-in-out;
			}
			Animation property
			The animation property is a shorthand way to define the above properties:

			animation: animation-name animation-duration animation-timing-function animation-iteration-count animation-direction animation-delay animation-fill-mode
			The first two parameters, which provide the animation title and timing, are required. The rest of the values ​​are optional.

			Let's take the following set of properties:

			animation-name: backgroundColorAnimation;
			animation-duration: 5s;
			animation-timing-function: ease-in-out;
			animation-iteration-count: 3;
			animation-direction: alternate;
			animation-delay: 1s;
			animation-fill-mode: forwards;
			This set will be equivalent to the following animation definition:

			animation: backgroundColorAnimation 5s ease-in-out 3 alternate 1s forwards;
				
		-->
        <style>
			@keyframes backgroundColorAnimation {
                from {
					background-color: tomato;
				}
				25%{
					background-color: orange;
				}
				50%{
					background-color: yellow;
				}
				75%{
					background-color: purple;
				}
				to {
					background-color: blue;
				}
            }
            div{
                width: 150px;
                height: 150px;
                margin: 50px 30px;
                border: 3px solid gray;
                background-color: tomato;
            }
			div:hover{                 
				animation-name: backgroundColorAnimation;
				animation-duration: 5s;
				animation-timing-function: ease-in-out;
				animation-iteration-count: 3;
				animation-direction: alternate;
				animation-fill-mode: forwards;
			}
